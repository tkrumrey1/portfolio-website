      <p class="project-description">
        This rocket is being built by a team of 30 students split into structures, fluids, propulsion, and avionics teams. 
        As part of the structures team, I am responsible for designing, analyzing, manufacturing, and integrating metallic and composite components. 
        I am also working with the fluids and propulsion teams to test the vehicle. 

        <br><br> 1. Integrated vehicle being carried to test stand at the Mojave test site (featuring D. and M.)
        <br> 2. Integrated structures and fluids systems prepared for testing, ground support equipment table in background

      <p class="project-description">
        In addition to my contributions to the structural design and manufacturing of the vehicle, I am also assisting integration and testing operations of the fluids and propulsion teams. 
        Prior to launch, a few key milestones must be achieved. 
        First, the engine must be cold flowed with liquid nitrogen to characterize it's behavior under cryogenic temperatures. 
        Then, the engine is static fired on a test stand to characterize it's properties under operational conditions. 
        Following that, the vehicle is cold flowed with liquid nitrogen, and then static fired in a full flight configuration. 
        I have worked with the team to complete multiple engine and vehicle cold flows, and engine static fires. 
        From the results of these tests, we are adjusting the system and will soon be static firing the vehicle in preperation for launch.

      <h1 class="project-section">Coupler Ring</h1>
      <p class="project-description">
        The coupler ring on Halya attaches two sections of the rocket: the aluminum frame of the pressurant section, and the composite tube housing the upper avionics and recovery bay.
        As the respnosible engineer for this component, I estimated the loads applied during launch and recovery, and then began performing component level FEA analysis in ANSYS Mechanical.
        Based on the results of that analysis, I iterated the geometry in Solidworks, reinforcing high stress areas.
        As I approached a final design, I ran higher fidelity assembly level simulations that included the bolted joints and surrounding components.
        I continued iterating until the component achieved an acceptable safety margin with minimal weight.
        Now, I am in the process of machining this component out of aluminum 7075.

      <p class="project-description">
        I was responsible for developing the manufacturing process for Halya's aeropanels, 3 foot long quarter cylinder panels that enclose the aluminum structure.
        I first used a MDF mold to manufacture a fiberglass wet layup mold that was oven safe.
        Then I manufactured ASTM tensile and SBS coupons for testing. These coupons were manufactured with varied processes, confirming the material properties and experimentally determining the optimal layup procedure.
        Following that, I manufactured a full set of 8 aeropanels.
