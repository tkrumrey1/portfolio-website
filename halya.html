      <h1 class="project-section">Operations</h1>
      <p class="project-description">
        In addition to my contributions to the structural design and manufacturing of the vehicle, I am also assisting integration and testing operations of the fluids and propulsion teams. 
        Prior to launch, a few key milestones must be achieved. 
        First, the engine must be cold flowed with liquid nitrogen to charachterize it's behavior under cryogenic temperatures. 
        Then, the engine is static fired on a test stand to characterize it's properties under operational conditions.
        Following that, the vehicle is cold flowed with liquid nitrogen, and then static fired in a full flight configuration.
        I have worked with the team to complete multiple engine and vehicle cold flows, and engine static fires.
        From the results of these tests, we are adjusting the system and will soon be static firing the vehicle in preperation for launch.

      <h1 class="project-section">Coupler Ring</h1>
      <p class="project-description">
        The coupler ring on Halya attaches two sections of the rocket: the aluminum skeleton of the pressurant section, and the composite tube housing the upper avionics and recovery bay.
        As a result of this configuration, this one component occupies the full cross section of the vehicle and therefore it will be exposed to the full loads on the vehicle during launch and recovery.
        As the respnosible engineer for this component, I began with a bare bones design consiting of the interface surfaces and minimal connecting geometry. 
        Based on the FEA analysis of that geometry, performed in ANSYS Mechanical, I evaluated reinforced high stress areas and iterated the geometry until it achieved an acceptable factor of safety.
        Once the individual component level simulations gave a satisfactory result, I began doing assembly level simulations that included the bolts and surrounding components.
        This gave a more accurate view of the loading and support interactions, and allowed me to further refine the geometry.
        Now, I am in the process of machining this component out of aluminum 7075.

      <h1 class="project-section">Composites</h1>
      <p class="project-description">
        Halya includes numerous composite components with the purpose of reducing weight and improving strength. 
        I was responsible for developing the manufacturing process for Halya's aeropanels. 
        These 3 foot long quarter cylinders are bolted to the aluminum struts and close off the pressurant and main valve sections during flight. 
        Their purpose is to reinforce the aluminum skeleton and handle aerodynamic loads while minimizing weight. 
        To manufacture these, I used prepreg carbon fiber, which posed a challenge: the mold for the parts had to be oven safe.
        While an aluminum mold would achieve excellent results, the cost was far too high for this application. 
        Instead, I used a much less expensive MDF mold to make a composite mold via fiberglass wet layup. 
        The first version of this mold failed to achieve the required stiffness, so I made a second version with chopped fiberglass.
        Using that second mold, I manufactured a full set of aeropanels, but testing revealed that our lack of autoclave access had led to insufficient pressure during curing and resulted in parts that were not strong enough to be used.
        Following that result, I began working with a new prepreg carbon fiber system, and prior to manufacturing the final panels, I manufactured multiple coupons with a variety of procedures, and then conducted ASTM tensile and SBS testing. 
        The results of these test revealed that our process was giving sufficient results, and also indicated which process had the best results. 
        Using the experimentally determined process, I am now manufacturing a new set of aeropanels.

      <h1 class="project-section">Launch Kugs</h1>
      <p class="project-description">
        The launch lugs are attached to the outside of the vehicle and are responsible for guiding it along the launch rail during launch. 
        During this brief stage of flight, they are subjected to extreme forces. 
        I was responsible for designing, analyzing, and machining these components.
        I started by analyzing the situation to estimate the maximum loads applied to the component, and then began designing an first draft.
        With that first draft, I began performing FEA analysis using ANSYS Mechanical, simulating the maximum expected load case. 
        With the results of that analysis, I iterated the design, repeatedly the analysis and adjusting the geometry until I achieved the optimal balance between factor of safety, weight, cost, and manufacturability.
        Then I used Fusion 360 to design the toolpaths and a Haas VF-2 to machine the final components from aluminum 6061.
